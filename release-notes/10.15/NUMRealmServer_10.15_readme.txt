1.0 Fix Name

Universal Messaging webMethods RealmServer 10.15 SP0 Fix 21



2.0 Fix ID

NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix21



3.0 Product(s)/Component(s) Affected

Universal Messaging webMethods RealmServer 10.15 SP0



4.0 Requirements

None.



5.0 Platform Support

Same platforms as product release.



6.0 Cautions and Warnings

Consider the following important information:

- It is strongly advisable that the Universal Messaging client libraries
are patched together with the realm server binaries, and that both are kept
up to date with the latest Universal Messaging official fix set.



7.0 Fix Contents

In addition to including resolutions to product defects, a fix may also include
enhancements to existing functionality and features. Any of these items can 
result in new or changed built-in services, APIs, or configuration parameters. 
Review the fix contents carefully before applying the fix.
 	
This fix is cumulative, which means that it is an aggregate of previous fixes 
for the release.

NUM-23134 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix21)

When UM server or client is trying to do reverse lookup for the client ip, more logs are added at 
the appropriate log levels, to indicate whether the DNS lookup consumes more time than expected. 
This will provide more information in identifying issues with client-server connectivity.

NUM-23081 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix21)

The following JVM options introduced in Universal Messaging 10.15 Fix 19 to support Java 17 as a 
runtime are removed from the Server_Common.conf file because they are unnecessary:
-wrapper.java.additional.300=--add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED
-wrapper.java.additional.301=--add-opens=java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED 
However, the Universal Messaging server and Java client applications using the admin or client API 
still need these options in the following cases:
- To use the Universal Messaging server 10.15 with Java 17 after you migrate from an older Universal 
Messaging version that had stores of type Paged. You must add the two options to the 
Server_Common.conf or Custom_Server_Common.conf file as additional parameters.
- To use shared memory with Java 17. You must add the two options to the Server_Common.conf or 
Custom_Server_Common.conf file of the Universal Messaging server as additional parameters and to 
the JVM that starts the Java client application.

NUM-21758 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix20)

A Universal Messaging server might shut down with out-of-memory (OOM) errors after cluster or 
channel recovery.
The issue occurs because during recovery a large window of large events, 100 or more events, is 
loaded into the heap.
This issue is now resolved.

NUM-21543 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix20)

Updated bouncycastle libraries to 1.78.1 to address security vulnerabilities.

NUM-21496 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix20)

When you delete a reliable queue, Universal Messaging does not remove the empty folder associated 
with the queue, which might slow down performance if many folders accumulate.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-23127 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix20)

Universal Messaging no longer provides a separate tools container image on the Software AG Container 
Repository. 
As an alternative, you can run a Universal Messaging server container in serverless mode by passing 
TOOLS_ONLY=true environment variable when starting a container. Containers started in this way can 
only be used to run the included administrative tools to manage other containers.

NUM-22840 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix19)

Universal Messaging now supports both Java 17 and Java 11 as a runtime for the server, client, and 
sample applications components.

NUM-23071 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix19)

Using the ?nstopserver? command in a Docker environment might result in a Universal Messaging server 
not shutting down gracefully and returning errors upon restart.
The issue might happen in cases when there are many channels and queues, and the server did not have 
enough time to complete all the processes when stopping.
The issue is resolved. You can use the ?nserverdaemon stop? command on UNIX instead of ?nstopserver? 
to stop the server gracefully.
For more information about stopping the server and its behavior during shutdown, see the Universal 
Messaging documentation.

NUM-21734 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix18)

A Universal Messaging server fails to start with a NullPointerException when there are empty indexed 
durables.
The issue is resolved.

NUM-21411 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix18)

Super users on remote hosts can bypass mandatory authentication regardless of the validity of their 
credentials.
The issue is now resolved. Only super users on localhost are exempt from authentication.

NUM-21337 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix18)

On the Windows platform JVM's do not support millisecond resolution when using the 
java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport#parkNanos methods causing delays up to 15 milliseconds when 
expecting only 1 millisecond. A solution has been implemented that overcomes this issue by enabling 
1 millisecond clock resolution with the use of java.lang.Thread#sleep(long) on a thread for the 
life of the JVM.

NUM-21311 (NUM_10.15_wM_RealmServer_Fix18)

The CreateJMSQueue and CreateJMSTopic tools, and any other Universal Messaging command-line 
administration tools associated with stores (channels and queues) now create stores of type Mixed 
when you use the tool without specifying the store type.
Previously, the tools created stores of type Reliable.
In addition, in the Universal Messaging Java client API, the constructors 
com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nChannelAttributes.nChannelAttributes() and 
com.pcbsys.nirvana.client.nChannelAttributes.nChannelAttributes(String name) now create mixed 
stores by default instead of reliable ones.
Also, the methods in nSession and nRealmNode that create channels or queues create mixed stores 
instead of reliable ones if you do not set the type of the store (channel or queue) explicitly.
You can use a new system property on the client side, com.softwareag.um.client.DefaultChannelType, 
to specify the type of stores created when using the administration tools and the 
nChannelAttributes constructors. Valid values are ?mixed?, ?reliable?, and ?persistent?. 


8.0 Installation

If you are installing a Universal Messaging server fix, please shut down any running Universal
Messaging server instances before installing.
In case the Universal Messaging server instance is a member of a cluster, please apply the
procedure for installing rolling cluster updates described below(*).

If you are installing a Universal Messaging client fix, please shut down any applications such as
Integration server or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are installing a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager fix, you do not need to shut down the
Universal Messaging server.

Install using the Software AG Update Manager or Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions,
see the corresponding documentation at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

(*) Universal Messaging cluster is supporting rolling updates for its nodes.
There is a strong recommendation to start applying the new fixes on the Slave nodes and leave the
Master node to be the last one.

For each single node that is part of the cluster the customer needs to follow the steps:
1) Shutdown the node. The node will be disconnected from the cluster.
2) Apply the specific fix
3) Start the node. It will be connected back again to the cluster and will be operational
4) Apply the same procedure from 1-3 steps on the next node

In order to have truly no downtime, the client that talks to the Universal Messaging cluster should
also be implemented in a way that it tolerates brief connection loss. A rolling update in a cluster
still means that:
a) When the node that a client is connected to is brought down for maintenance, the connection to
this server, and respectively the cluster, will be lost and has to be re-established. The client
should be able to handle this seamlessly.
b) When the master node of the cluster is brought down for maintenance, the cluster will briefly
go offline until a new master is elected. This is usually a very short time window, but still,
similarly to point a). The client applications should be able to handle it in order to have truly
no downtime from the point of view of the end user.



9.0 Uninstallation

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging server fix,
please note that any running Universal Messaging server
instances will be automatically shutdown before installing.

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging client fix, 
please shut down any applications such as Integration Server 
or Enterprise Manager which are using client libraries.

If you are uninstalling a Universal Messaging Enterprise Manager 
fix, you do not need to shut down the Universal Messaging server.

Uninstall using the Software AG Update Manager or 
Command Central (9.5 or later). For instructions, see the 
corresponding documentation 
at http://documentation.softwareag.com.

Note: These instructions can only be used to uninstall the 
most recently installed fix. This action will revert your 
installation to the previously installed fix. You cannot 
apply these instructions to the previously installed fix.



10.0 Globalization

This fix conforms to the internationalization standards of the webMethods 
product suite and includes support for operation in any country, locale, or 
language as specified in the Installing webMethods Products guide. It was not 
tested with non-English configurations and non-ASCII data. However, this fix has
no globalization impact and can be applied to systems running in any supported 
locale or configuration.



10.1 Localization

This fix does not require an updated Language Pack. It might contain new 
messages and these messages will appear in English.
