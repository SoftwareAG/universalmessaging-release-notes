[10.15.0.2] NUM-18913

The Docker image for the Universal Messaging server now supports the log4j2 framework for logging 
and provides a default log4j2 configuration. The default log4j2 configuration does NOT store the 
nirvana.log log file on disk but streams the log output to STDOUT.
You can configure the UM the server logging level, by using the UM Admin API or Enterprise Manager 
after you enable the Log4j2 logging framework for the container.
For more details about log4j2 support in Docker images for Universal Messaging, see the Universal 
Messaging documentation.

[10.15.0.2] NUM-18890

When you use Software AG Installer to create a Universal Messaging Docker image, the logs directory 
is not present by default in the installation. 
Instead, the directory gets created when you run the container. This sets the directory's user to 
root, which makes the logs directory inaccessible to the Universal Messaging server in the 
container, because the server runs as non-root user.
This issue is now resolved.

[10.15.0.0] NUM-19088

Several classpath configurations for Log4j2 were missing from the Server_Common.conf file in our 
Universal Messaging Server docker images. As a result it was not possible to start containers with 
Log4j2 logging enabled.
The issue is now resolved.

[10.15.0.0] NUM-16857

Running the Software AG command-line tools in the <SoftwareAG_directory>\common\bin directory
in a Docker container fails due to an incorrect directory path in the scripts.
The issue is resolved.

[10.15.0.0] NUM-15197

The Universal Messaging RealmInformationCollector tool fails to run in a Docker container.
When you try to start the RealmInformationCollector in a Docker container, the tool returns
the following error: 'Universal Messaging realm server component not present in the current
installation directory (/opt/softwareag/UniversalMessaging/tools/runner/./../../..). 
So this operation is not applicable.' 
This issue is now resolved.
