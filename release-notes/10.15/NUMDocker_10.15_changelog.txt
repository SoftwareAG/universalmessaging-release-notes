Several files created by the Docker context were being included in the Docker image which could

The Universal Messaging RealmInformationCollector tool fails to run in a Docker container.
When you try to start the RealmInformationCollector in a Docker container, the tool returns
the following error: 'Universal Messaging realm server component not present in the current
installation directory (/opt/softwareag/UniversalMessaging/tools/runner/./../../..). 
So this operation is not applicable.' 
This issue is now resolved.
